# Control Energenie switches.
# Note, at the moment, this only works with MiHome Adaptor Plus devices
# because the 'sensorid' is discovered via the monitor message.
# You could probably fake it by preloading the directory with your sensorid
# if you know what it is.

# Note, this is *only* a test program, to exercise the lower level code.
# Don't expect this to be a good starting point for an application.
# Consider waiting for me to finish developing the device object interface first.
