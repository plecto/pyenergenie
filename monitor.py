# Monitor Energine MiHome plugs

# Note, this is *only* a test program, to exercise the lower level code.
# Don't expect this to be a good starting point for an application.
# Consider waiting for me to finish developing the device object interface first.
#
# However, it will log all messages from MiHome monitor, adaptor plus and house monitor
# to a CSV log file, so could be the basis for a non-controlling energy logging app.
